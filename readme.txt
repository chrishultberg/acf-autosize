A wordpress plugin to automatically resize and improve upon wysiwyg and textarea fields in Advanced Custom Fields

== Description ==

## Features
- Automatically resize wysiwyg and textarea fields in ACF groups
- Add `data-wysiwyg-slug='my-wysiwyg-field'` to the body in tinymce iframes, so you can style those iframe's contents using editor-styles:

## Usage
- Install and activate like any other wordpress plugin
- `[data-wysiwyg-slug]` is added to *every* wysiwyg field!
- Add `autosize` as a class to a WYSIWYG or Textarea-Field to enable autosize for this field
- that's basically it.

## mu-plugin
`acf-autosize-mu.php` is a single-file drop-in version of acf-autosize for usage in your theme or mu-plugins. It contains the javascript and is AUTOGENERATED!
